    email = "<your_email>"
    email_password = "<your_email_password>"
    wolframalpha_id = "<your_wolframalpha_id>"
- Install all the requirements by just hitting ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
- Install PyAudio from wheel file by following instructions given [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55630212)
- Run the program by ``` python jarvis_gui.py ```
- Enjoy the voice assistant.

## Code Structure


    │── utils               # GUI images/ gifs
    ├── jarvis.ui           # GUI file (in .ui format)
    ├── jarvisui.py         # GUI file (in .py format)
    ├── main.py             # main driver program of Jarvis
    ├── jarvis_gui.py       # main exe file(linked GUI with main.py file)
    ├── setup.py            #code to hide cmd window while executing the program
    ├── requirements.txt    # all dependencies of the program

- The code structure if pretty simple. The code is completely modularized and is highly customizable.

## Future Improvements
- Generalized conversations can be made possible by incorporating Natural Language Processing
- Addying more languages with english
- GUI can be made more nicer to look at and functional
- More functionalities can be added.
